## Things to do before you need to build OFFICIAL/OFFICIALLY

- Ask the core team members for the LegionOS-Devices github org access and push your repos
        
    - Push in the same branch name as the rom's branch name [eg: 11/12/snowcone/T]

    - Must have the dependencies properly added in the legion.dependencies file and the file should be formatted well

    - Also must name the repo only like [vendor_branch_device(chip)/vendor_branch_device(chip)-common] no other naming will be encouraged nor supported **Exception Exist under some cases**

- Ask the core team members for the legionrom sourceforge access 

- Run the command  "ssh username@frs.sourceforge.net" once u get your sourceforge access [This needs to be done everytime if u change ur pc/format it]

## Flags to add before you need to build OFFICIAL/OFFICIALLY
        

        -> LEGION_BUILD_TYPE := OFFICIAL

	-> ro.legion.maintainer=Dr.RajKale

	-> Need this overlay (https://github.com/legionos-devices/android_device_realme_rmx3371/commit/6aba7ecb5ac3cf9c5cd17b0f90dae397ae67a6fc)

>`No other flags needed to be added.`

## To  push ur device update/release to our chanel  and do OTA 
    
- Just fork the OTA repo in the LegionOS-Device github org repo and then clone it to the source dir then do "python3 OTA/support/ota.py" then  add your devicr changelog then push the changes to your git then make the pull
request and everyhting should be good

## Note :- 

- DO NOT edit the json manually

- DO NOT edit the script also read

- Do check the git history on how the files are changed and do accordingly

- Must update the tree to the org and make it public

- If the above rules are not followed you will be removed (just kidding, but can be real too, so be careful)
